# Dusk-calc-zen

A modern, full-featured calculator web application with memory functions, scientific operations, and a sleek user interface with dark mode support.

## Features and Functionality

*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Memory Functions:** Store, recall, add to, and subtract from memory (MC, MR, M+, M-).
*   **Scientific Operations:** Square root, exponents, percentage calculations, and the inclusion of Pi (Ï€).
*   **Rounding:** Round the displayed number to 0 or 2 decimal places.
*   **Sign Toggle:** Change the sign of the displayed number (+/-).
*   **Clear Functions:** Clear the entire calculator (AC) or the current entry (CE).
*   **Responsive Design:**  The calculator is designed to be responsive and work on different screen sizes.
*   **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes using the `DarkModeToggle` component located at `src/components/DarkModeToggle.tsx`.  The theme is persisted using `document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark')`.
*   **3D Card Effect:** Uses a visually appealing 3D card effect for the calculator interface, implemented in `src/components/ui/3d-card.tsx`.
*   **React Query:** Utilizes `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching and state management (although currently not actively used for data fetching but is setup in `src/App.tsx` for future API calls).
*   **Toaster Notifications:** Employs `sonner` and `@/components/ui/toaster` for providing user feedback through toast notifications.

## Technology Stack

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
*   **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast and efficient development experience.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly styling the application.
*   **Radix UI:** A set of unstyled, accessible UI primitives. The project utilizes many Radix UI components located in `src/components/ui/*`.
*   **React Router:** For handling navigation between different pages (`src/App.tsx`).
*   **Lucide React:** For icons.

## Prerequisites
